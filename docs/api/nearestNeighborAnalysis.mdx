### Description

Nearest Neighbor Analysis calculates an index based the average distances
between points in the dataset, thereby providing inference as to whether the
data is clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed within the study area.

It returns a \{@link Feature\<Polygon>} of the study area, with the results of
the analysis attached as part of of the `nearestNeighborAnalysis` property
of the study area's `properties`. The attached
[_z_-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) indicates how many
standard deviations above or below the expected mean distance the data's
observed mean distance is. The more negative, the more clustered. The more
positive, the more evenly dispersed. A _z_-score between -2 and 2 indicates
a seemingly random distribution. That is, within _p_ of less than 0.05, the
distribution appears statistically significantly neither clustered nor
dispersed.

**Remarks**

- Though the analysis will work on any [FeatureCollection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3) type, it
  works best with [Point](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2) collections.
- This analysis is _very_ sensitive to the study area provided.
  If no \{@link Feature\<Polygon>} is passed as the study area, the function draws a box
  around the data, which may distort the findings. This analysis works best
  with a bounded area of interest within with the data is either clustered,
  dispersed, or randomly distributed. For example, a city's subway stops may
  look extremely clustered if the study area is an entire state. On the other
  hand, they may look rather evenly dispersed if the study area is limited to
  the city's downtown.
