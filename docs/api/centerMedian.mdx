### Description

Takes a [FeatureCollection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3) of points and calculates the median center,
algorithimically. The median center is understood as the point that is
requires the least total travel from all other points.

Turfjs has four different functions for calculating the center of a set of
data. Each is useful depending on circumstance.

`@turf/center` finds the simple center of a dataset, by finding the
midpoint between the extents of the data. That is, it divides in half the
farthest east and farthest west point as well as the farthest north and
farthest south.

`@turf/center-of-mass` imagines that the dataset is a sheet of paper.
The center of mass is where the sheet would balance on a fingertip.

`@turf/center-mean` takes the averages of all the coordinates and
produces a value that respects that. Unlike `@turf/center`, it is
sensitive to clusters and outliers. It lands in the statistical middle of a
dataset, not the geographical. It can also be weighted, meaning certain
points are more important than others.

`@turf/center-median` takes the mean center and tries to find, iteratively,
a new point that requires the least amount of travel from all the points in
the dataset. It is not as sensitive to outliers as `@turf/center-mean`, but it is
attracted to clustered data. It, too, can be weighted.
