In preparation for the v7 release of Turf, we've updated Turf's website to run on [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). This brings with it a lot of advantages, one of the main ones being versioned documentation.

Versioning will allow us to keep the website up-to-date with the latest documentation, while catering to legacy versions as well.

If you notice any website quirks or broken links, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf-www/issues) if it hasn't already been reported.
